# Medical_Analysis_Expert_System

This repository contains the code and resources for the Medical Analysis Expert System. The system is designed to identify the presence of diseases in the patients taking the common symptoms as a factor and return a predictive response. The main motivation behind this project is to help the rural areas of India get the access to easy medical services with low to almost no cost. This project is divided into two units, one with various Machine Learning Models for each disease individually whereas one Expert System with rule-fact operating mechanism for all the diseases taking in the similar deciding factors.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following components:

- **Backend**: Contains the multiple ML models as well as the expert system for identification of the disease present.
- **Frontend**: Includes the frontend code for user interface to collect the data from the patient regarding the presence of the symptoms.
- **Data**: Stores the datasets and CSV files required to train and test the multiple ML models for each disease.
